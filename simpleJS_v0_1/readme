Suppose I don't care about making a web application, but I want to have a GUI for my simple JavaScript
code, and have access to the local filesystem as well as to the GUI...
And code as little as possible...
How can I do it?

This example was manually generated to see how the coupling between the pseudo-code in "simpleJS_code_v2.txt"
and an actual web-app could be. 
This experiment is written as a small Express server, that opens its own client (a static HTML page),
then the 2 talk via websockets.
A very basic CSS is added to show how the GUI could look like.

The dependencies of the application should be installed first with:
   npm install
then 
   npm start
will start both server and a single client.

For Windows users, the 2 batch files do that for you.


(the folder node_modules can be removed to clean; all packages will be automatically reinstalled)
